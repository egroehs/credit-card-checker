# Credit card checker
Project for codecademy full-stack engineer career path

The purpose of validateCred() is to return true when an array contains digits of a valid credit card number and false when it is invalid. This function should NOT mutate the values of the original array.

The role of findInvalidCards() is to check through the nested array for which numbers are invalid, and return another nested array of invalid cards.

idInvalidCardCompanies() should return an array of companies that have mailed out cards with invalid numbers. This array should NOT contain duplicates.
